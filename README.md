This is a dummy restaurant page made in order to learn JS modules and webpack. To see the original requirements, go here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page

### Lessons Learned: ###
#### JS/ npm/ webpack: ####
The goal of this project was to create a restaurant page using primarily JS w/ a focus on learning JS modules, webpack, and npm. HTML content is created dynamically using a virtual DOM completely written in JS. Along w/ DOM manipulation, I also focused on delegating functions in an object-oriented way using modules. This is also the first time I've used npm, webpack, json, etc.

#### CSS/ styling ####
This page is designed to be responsive down to a resolsution of 412px (Galaxy Note). I also practiced importing, organizing, and using fonts, and images with style, url, and css-loaders.
